Vite automatically serves a directory named public at the root of your project as static assets. 
Any files placed in the public directory are copied as-is to the root of the dist folder during 
build and are served at the root URL during development.

You do not need to configure this—Vite looks for a folder named public by default. 
For example, a file at public/robots.txt will be available at 
http://localhost:5173/robots.txt in dev and at /robots.txt in your production build.

If you want to change this behavior, you can configure the publicDir option in your 
vite.config.js, but by default, Vite always uses the public directory at the project root.
